title: A Basic Grid Object
---
It didn't occur to me that my Grid implementation could be more generally useful
until I saw all the implementations of the "Snake" AI game out on Github. I cloned
a Javascript version (I didn't find any Swift versions(!), so I decided to
port one from Javascript). But its grid handling was ad-hoc, no formal structures
to represent it. I wrote my grid-handling the same way for a while, but a powerful
and easy-to-use grid makes the code so much easier to reason about and way less bug-prone.
