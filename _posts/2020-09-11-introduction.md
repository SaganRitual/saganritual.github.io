I've been working on my hobby-project [_Arkonia_](https://github.com/SaganRitual/Arkonia) for some years now. It had already grown into a large and complex system when I started using SwiftUI  for the HUD, rather than my clumsy SpriteKit attempts. It seems time to take a breath and step back from my project, to consider its overall design, to examine the design of each component, to decide whether I can improve on anything to make the code easier to understand and debug, and of course for the app to run well.

Some of the components seem like they might have some more general use than what I'm doing, or perhaps they can save someone some work who's trying to do something similar. So while I go through my enormous codebase, I'll post stuff here that seems useful, with some commentary.

We'll see how it goes.
